@article{Goleman1998leader,
Abstract = {Superb leaders have very different ways of directing a team, a division, or a company. Some are subdued and analytical; others are charismatic and go with their gut. And different situations call for different types of leadership. Most mergers need a sensitive negotiator at the helm, whereas many turnarounds require a more forceful kind of authority. Psychologist and noted author Daniel Goieman has found, however, that effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. In fact, Goleman's research at nearly 200 large, global companies revealed that emotional intelligence--especially at the highest levels of a company--is the sine qua non for leadership. Without it, a person can have first-class training, an incisive mind, and an endless supply of good ideas, hut he still won't make a great leader. The components of emotional intelligence--self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social ski},

@article{Goleman1998emotional,
Abstract = {This article presents information on an emotional intelligence among executives. Clearly there's a difference between rational and emotional intelligence. Both are essential to success, but only the former is in abundant evidence in organizational leadership. There is little variation in IQ among most people in leadership positions, in technical or professional arenas, people need an IQ of 115 or 120 to get into their field. However, there is huge variation in their emotional capability, which, unlike innate intelligence, can be consciously developed. Studies of outstanding performers in hundreds of organizations show that about two-thirds of the abilities that set apart star performers from the rest are based on emotional intelligence, only one-third of the skills that matter relate to raw intelligence and technical expertise.
