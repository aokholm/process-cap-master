\section{Introduction}

\section{Actors}
In most manufacturings companies you will find that there are three main groups responsible for producing high quality products.

The designer engineers task is to design products which great value for the end customer. 
His design should find the optimal compromise between design simplicity, insensitiveness to manufacturing variation and the actual manufacturing capabilities. 

The manufacture, internal or external, will produce the design usually as an 'best effort'. Lastly it's the task of the control engineer to make sure that the  




\section{The Problem}

Reasons why PCDB are not more in use than it is today.

\begin{itemize}

\item{Design engineers are often unfamiliar with their firm’s capability to manufacture parts (Tata and Thornton 1999).}
\item{Making manufacturing data easy to retrieve for design engineers is difficult because it is often dispersed throughout an organization and can be in numerous unique forms, making it difficult to interpret. (Kern 2003).}
\item{lack of a company-wide vision for PCD usage and poor communication between manufacturing and design. (tata 1999)}
\item{Although companies have created process capability databases (PCDBs), the data is not being utilized by design. (tata 1999)}
\item{Design’s lack of trust and understanding of data. (tata 1999).}
\item{Lack of incentives for PCD use.(tata 1999).}
