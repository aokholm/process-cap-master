\section{Introduction}

A Process Capability DataBase (PCDB)  is a tool for mechanical designers to get information of what is possible to achieve in the companys production. By applying PC information in the design process it is possible to reduces: rework, cost, failure rate, assembly problems and increases product performance.
A in few words a PCDB is a database of variance in features on produced products. Different companies have different index system and standards for what to record. 

As mentioned in \citep{tata1999process, tata1999effective, raskokholm} and a number for key challenges has to be addressed to expand the use of PCDB.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Retrievable data: The database has to be populated with the desired data in a understandable manner. From (Tata) we have learned that the data already recorded in the process control is not necessary the desired data for the mechanical designer. 
	\item User Interface: Accessing the information should be easy.
	\item Organizational: Development department are dependent on data from production. 
	\item Information Technology: Make a database which is fast, live, global, self populating, up to date and live up to the industry criteria of security and anonymity.
\end{itemize}

Previous attempts on solving these problems 
(\cite{kern2003forecasting, thornton2004variation})

\section{Predicting Process Capability}

The data desired by the designer can be syntetisized to PC data of a geometry, material and process in order to design for what is achievable in production. 
The data recoded by process control can be processed to describe geometries for the process and material instead of specific features on a specific product thus making the process control data from one product, whose only similarity with the designed product is the geometrical features only, available for use for the designer.

Introduction to the Process of generalization of PCDB

\begin{enumerate}
 	\item Generate component measurement sets. 
	\item Compute Process Capability Specification Limit (PCSL).
	\item Normalize PCSL.
	\item Fit distribution to selection of multiple normalized PCSL sets.
\end{enumerate}

	Generation of measurement sets might seem trivial but since what you measure is what you get. Teh selection of measurement data is important to the resulting information.

\subsection{Process Capability Indicies}
The process capability indices ($C_p$ and $C_{pk}$) described by \cite{kane1986process} has been widely adopted in statistical process control, been extended and further researched for better understanding \citep{wu2009overview}. 
Instead of looking at process mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$ and specification upper and lower limits $USL$, $LSL$ using Process Capabilities Indices (PCIs) transforms these values into unit less numbers, which provides a quick overview of how a process is performing.

The PCIs ability to transform process variables of any object into unit less capability index can be reversed to calculate desirable specification limits. For en example the commonly used CPI $C_pk$ 
\begin{equation}
	C_{pk} = \frac{d - | \mu - m|}{3 \sigma}
\end{equation}
can be reversed
\begin{equation}
	d = 3 C_{pk} \sigma + | \mu - m|
\end{equation}
where $d = (USL - LSL) / 2$ is half the specification limit and $m = (USL + LSL) / 2$ is the midpoint between the specification limits. 

The most common PCIs and what they describe \citep{wu2009overview, taguchi1986introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $C_a$ : Closeness of process mean to target 
	\item $C_p$ : Relative size of variation
	\item $C_{pk}$ : Amount of nonconforming (\%NC)
	\item $C_{pm}$ : Value loss (Taguchi loss function)
	\item $C_{pmk}$: Version of $C_{pm}$,  sensitive to mean shift. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graph_postscript_test.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:cpk} $c_p$ referens only to the variance of the process. $c_{pk}$ is related to the yield of the product. $c_{pm}$ takes a loss function in to account relates to a target dimension. $cpmk$ takes both the yield of the product and a loss function. }
\end{figure}

For the purpose of our database we have chosen to use $C_{pk}$, since it provides the most easily understandable result. The desired specification limit will result in a maximum percentage of NC products. Using $C_{pm}$ would be sensible sense if the desired tolerances directly influence product performance - for instance in optics construction.  


\subsection{Normalization}

Comparison of different standard tolerance dimension relations. 

ISO 286? describes a non-linear function for comparing tolerances on objects of different dimension. This function used to normalize tolerances and display PC independent of size (with in the limits of the function.)

\section{Statistical Validity}

measurement sets are assumed to fit a normal distribution.

What you measure is what you get.
Each product in the sample set, produces a measurement. From the sample set is a  measurement set created. 

Confidence intervals - sample size of each measurement set.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{stats_bias_confidence.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:std_uncertainty}The uncertainty of the standard deviation estimate is reduced as the number of samples is increased. The increase in accuracy gained per additional decreases with more samples. From the graph we have chosen 12 to be the optimal point for general process capability use.}
\end{figure}

Availability of the data is important. The reward for using PCDB or robust design in general to make changes in early design is a long reach compared the reward for the hero in production solving the expensive errors in design. The importance of the tool being easy to use 

In order to make the mechanical designers use the tool, it is important that the data is easy to sort through and make decisions of what is the desired information, and then find it.


A cross company platform is suggested to populate the database. The gain is diverse data to be able to compare materials and processes.
