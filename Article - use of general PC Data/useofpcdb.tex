%Introduction

A Process Capability DataBase (PCDB) is a tool for mechanical designers to get information of what is possible to achieve in the companies production. This is done by storing and displaying statistical information about features on produced components.  
By applying Process Capability (PC) information in the design process it is possible to reduces: rework, cost, failure rate, assembly problems and increases product performance \citep{tata1999process}.

As mentioned in \citep{tata1999process, tata1999effective, raskokholm} and a number for key challenges has to be addressed to expand the use of PCDB.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data Communication: The databases are typically not easily searchable which makes it very difficult to find the correct data and in many cases the data sought after data does not exists. Further more the data is not presented in a way which is easily understandable by mechanical designers.
	\item Fragmented Organization: Development department are dependent on data from production. 
	\item Information Technology: Make a database which is fast, live, global, self populating, up to date and live up to the industry criteria of security and anonymity.
\end{itemize}

There has been a couple of attempts in academia to solve some of these difficulties \citep{thornton2000use, kern2003forecasting, thornton2004variation}, but there hasn't much attention on the subject since indicating there is still issues to resolve before it can be efficiently used in the industry.

In this article we present a concept of data indexing, processing and presentation which tries to make it faster and easier for the mechanical designer to efficiently use process capability data in new designs. 
The general principle is to provide a interface where the data is presented in a much more generalised than typically done in PCDB interfaces. 
The core indexing scheme is simplified, but details are retained or improved using a flexible tagging system. 
Instead of presenting the designer with statistical information, actual recommended specifications limits is shown directly. 
The specification limits is normalised in regards to the specified dimension making more use out of each dataset, minimising the risk of database queries not returning any results. 

Combined with advances in Information Technology we hope this will help make PCDBs a viable tool in the mechanical design process. 

\section{Indexing}
PCDB data needs to be indexed to efficiently retrieve data of relevance to the current design. The data stores in a PCDBs are typically measurements sets; the statistical result of number of measurements of a given part dimension combined with the design characteristics design. Feature, geometry, material and process is suggested by \cite{kern2003forecasting} to be the primary Design Characteristics (DC). For each primary DC there exists a tree structure of possibilities. An example of an index using Kerns proposed design index could be "Plane", "Position", "Aluminium", "Turning". 

In some of the most used processes for mass produced parts like casting and injection moulding, it seems feature and geometry is not necessarily important DCs. The CAM machine milling the moulds does not recognise different features and does not adjust it's precision automatically (SOURCE?).

For our index,  \emph{material} and \emph{process} should be only required DCs. This is combined with a tagging systems, where tags also lives in tree structures. Using tags gives more flexibility since more than one tag can be applied to one measurement set and it's possible to index for design characteristics that's specific to a single production method or material. As an example for injection moulding it would be interesting to index the material type of the mould - aluminium, steel, hardened, ... Indexing the mould iterations (T0, T1, T2) could also give valuable insights about, which specification limits requires mould rework or process adjustment. A last example could to tag if the dimension measured across a parting line in the mould potentially showing a general increase in desired specification limits.

Most product specifications are just plain tolerances (SOURCE?)- these are all just variations of point to point measurements and can as such just be combines into one pool - diameters, positions, thickness, radii... ?

What is measured and since indexed limits the possible conclusions, which can be mades when extracting the data. If the goal is to understand the long term process capability impact of an injection mould process it's either necessary to have measurement sets from many products at different stages of their lifespan or multiple measurements through  the lifespan of a couple of products.    


\section{Processing Capability Data}

Processing the capability data consists of three setps: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compute Process Capability Specification Limit (PCSL).
	\item Normalize PCSL.
	\item Interpret normalised PCSL data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Process Capability Specification Limit}
The process capability indices ($C_p$ and $C_{pk}$) described by \cite{kane1986process} has been widely adopted in statistical process control, been extended and further researched for better understanding \citep{wu2009overview}. 
Instead of looking at process mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$ and specification upper and lower limits $USL$, $LSL$ using Process Capabilities Indices (PCIs) transforms these values into unit less numbers, which provides a quick overview of how a process is performing.

The PCIs ability to transform process variables of any object into unit less capability index can be reversed to calculate desirable specification limits. For en example the commonly used CPI $C_pk$ 
\begin{equation}
	C_{pk} = \frac{d - | \mu - m|}{3 \sigma}
\end{equation}
can be reversed
\begin{equation}
	d = 3 C_{pk} \sigma + | \mu - m|
\end{equation}
where $d = (USL - LSL) / 2$ is half the specification limit and $m = (USL + LSL) / 2$ is the midpoint between the specification limits. 

The most common PCIs and what they describe \citep{wu2009overview, taguchi1986introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $C_a$ : Closeness of process mean to target 
	\item $C_p$ : Relative size of variation
	\item $C_{pk}$ : Amount of nonconforming (\%NC)
	\item $C_{pm}$ : Value loss (Taguchi loss function)
	\item $C_{pmk}$: Version of $C_{pm}$,  sensitive to mean shift. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graph_postscript_test.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:cpk} $c_p$ referens only to the variance of the process. $c_{pk}$ is related to the yield of the product. $c_{pm}$ takes a loss function in to account relates to a target dimension. $cpmk$ takes both the yield of the product and a loss function. }
\end{figure}

For the purpose of our database we have chosen to use $C_{pk}$, since it provides the most easily understandable result. The desired specification limit will result in a maximum percentage of NC products. Using $C_{pm}$ would be sensible sense if the desired tolerances directly influence product performance - for instance in optics construction.  


\subsection{Normalization}

The data is normalized to relate the specify tolerance limits independent of size. By normalizing PC data it can be used to predict PC for any dimension within the limit of the normalization algorithm. 
This eliminates part of the problem of unpopulated the database since in it possible to use PC information from components of different sizes.

Different industrial standards present different relations between tolerance and dimension. 

For general linear tolerances as described in American ANSI B4-2 (1978) and the German DIN7168 (1991) and Europaen ISO 286-2 (1997) have slight difference but all present a nonlinear curve. For the same level for precision the tolerance of big dimensions is smaller relative to size than for component of a small dimension.

The danish standard DS812 and the French NFT58000 are standards that specifically relates to moulded plastic parts. These standards present an almost linear function. The difference can be a result of the creep in moulded plastic that is a percentage of volume and not a function of dimension.


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Tolerance_standards.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:tolstd} The danish standard DS812 (POM 120) and the French NFT58000 (normal) are standards specifically for moulded plastic components. They are almost linear for sizes above 10mm The American ANSI B4-2 (gr. 13) and the german DIN7168 (medium) and Europaen ISO 286-2 (IT13) describes the linear tolerances dimension relation. The tolerance is smaller for }
\end{figure}

The descriptions of the standards presents the data as tables for tolerances in dimension intervals. This poses a problem when trying classify the specific tolerance dimension to a precision level.
In a note for ANSI B4-2  and later mentioned in ISO 286:1993 a continues function is described for IT-grades between IT6 to IT16 for dimensions from 2mm to 500mm. This function is not included in newer versions of ISO 286.

\begin{align}
	tol =& 10^{0.2 (ITG -1)} \cdot i \\
	i =& 0.45 \sqrt[3]{D} + 10^{-3} \, D 
\end{align}

Where $i$ is standard tolerance factor, $D$ is the nominal dimension $D = \sqrt{D_1 D_2}$ and $T$ is the international tolerance in $\mu m$.

In the generalized PCDB the data is normalized using said function because ISO 286 is general practice in the industry. Future improvements to find formulation for normalization for the different process could be analyzed from a populated PCDB.

\section{Statistical Validity}

measurement sets are assumed to fit a normal distribution.

What you measure is what you get.
Each product in the sample set, produces a measurement. From the sample set is a  measurement set created. 

Confidence intervals - sample size of each measurement set.

\section{Discussion}

Using todays techonolgy, generalization of PC data upon request from the user i feasble. A proposed techincal setup is described in \cite{OkholmRask}.

Initiating PCG is a tough process. 
The reward for doing robust design engineering is long reach
The reward for using PCDB or robust design in general to make changes in early design is a long term and might only benefit the company and not feedback to the designers compared the reward for the hero in production solving the expensive errors in design.
